            <h2>Why we started RoomieRecipes</h2>
            <p>We are a team of young WebDevs who wanted to change the world for the better.
                how to better change it, than by changing the people in it? We thougt about what brings people together and
                what challenges them at the same time. And while sitting together and having to get something to eat we got it.
                <br>
                Food!
                <br>
                As young people we often thougt long and hard what to eat because of restrictions, either budgetery or timewise, it was always
                hard.
                <br>
                But no more RoomieRecipes is here to change everything making people love to cook and spend time together, while still
                being healthy and enjoying each others company.
